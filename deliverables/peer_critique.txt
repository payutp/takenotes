Peer Critique for rohanm.

SUMMARY ASSESSMENT FROM USER'S PERSPECTIVE

It's nice to implement the phone and email verifications, but when I signed up, I was redirected to the page with red text "We're sorry, but something went wrong," but I received an e-mail, so you should check how you redirect the page.

Since I did not got added to the whitelist, I modified the code so that it skipped verifications, and I didn't know how they work in verification steps.

I think you should allow multiple lines of content. Having only one line makes it hard for user to actually write down and keep track of stuff.

Having mailing and texting features is really cool. Although I have no change to try it since I didn't do the verifications, the feature could be really useful in some situation. Nice job overall.

SUMMARY ASSESSMENT FROM DEVELOPER'S PERSPECTIVE

Your code is well-organized and easy to understand. Nice use of comments since you includes requires/modifies/effects. Nothing to change. Nice work on implementing user removing, but I'm not sure if there will be a problem if one user just signed up and didn't verify yet, and then another user registered for an account, causing the first account to be deleted?


MOST AND LEAST SUCCESSFUL DECISIONS

Most:
Enforcing both e-mail and phone verifications. First I was thinking if only one was enough, but then I think you made the right decision, so that there is no spamming on text/e-mail.

Least:
I don't think there is any least successful decisions since your app seems to work as a medium for forwarding notes to e-mail/phone. Personally, I just don't like a one-line note, but if you have a reason behind that, then it is fine.

PRIORITIES FOR IMPROVEMENT
1. Check your redirect page after sign up.
2. You should consider allowing multiple lines of note.
3. Make sure that when a second user registers for the site, it doesn't delete the account of a recently registered user who haven't verified the account yet.
